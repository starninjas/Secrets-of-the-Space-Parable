# goodtorch
The slightly better torch. The original was made by me, then improved a lot by ApolloX, then I fixed something and added something, so here we are.

I created this fork so I and everyone else could commit and make changes with ease, as I couldn't do so with Beanzilla's original repo.
Everyone (especially you) is welcome to make further changes and fixes.

This torch mod utilizes the ray casting algorithm to calculate the endpoint where the beam shall shine.
Currently works when the flashlight is turned on and is anywhere in the inventory.
